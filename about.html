            Milne wrote the episodic stories of Winnie-the-Pooh and its sequel,
             The House at Pooh Corner (1928), for his young son, Christopher Robin,
              whose toy animals were the basis for many of the characters and whose name was used for
               the young boy who appears in the tales as the benign master of the animals.

               The main character, Winnie-the-Pooh (sometimes called simply Pooh or Edward Bear), is a
                good-natured, yellow-furred, honey-loving bear who lives in the Forest surrounding the 
                Hundred Acre Wood (modeled after Ashdown Forest in East Sussex, England). His companions
                 are Eeyore, a gloomy gray donkey; Piglet, a timid pig; Owl, a pontificating bird; the
                  meddlesome Rabbit; and Kanga, an energetic kangaroo whose inquisitive baby, Roo, lives
                   in her pouch.</p>

            Christopher Milne had named his toy bear after Winnie, a Canadian black bear he often
             saw at London Zoo, and "Pooh", a swan they had met while on holiday. The bear cub was 
             purchased from a hunter for $20 by Canadian Lieutenant Harry Colebourn in White River,
              Ontario, Canada, while en route to England during the First World War.

               He named the bear "Winnie" after his adopted hometown in Winnipeg, Manitoba. "Winnie" was surreptitiously brought to England with her owner,
                and gained unofficial recognition as The Fort Garry Horse regimental mascot. Colebourn 
                 Winnie at the London Zoo while he and his unit were in France; after the war she was officially
                  donated to the zoo, as she had become a much-loved attraction there Pooh the swan appears
                   as a character in its own right in When We Were Very Young.</p>

            The Winnie-the-Pooh stories are set in Ashdown Forest, East Sussex, England.
             The forest is an area of tranquil open heathland on the highest sandy ridges 
             of the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty situated 30 miles (50 km)
              south-east of London. In 1925 Milne, a Londoner, bought a country home a mile
               to the north of the forest at Cotchford Farm, near Hartfield. According to Christopher
                Milne, while his father continued to live in London "...the four of us – he, his wife,
                 his son and his son's nanny – would pile into a large blue, chauffeur-driven Fiat and 
                 travel down every Saturday morning and back again every Monday afternoon.
               <br>
               <br>
               <br>
               And we would spend a whole glorious month there in the spring and two months in the
                summer."[8] From the front lawn the family had a view across a meadow to a line of 
                alders that fringed the River Medway, beyond which the ground rose through more trees 
                until finally "above them, in the faraway distance, crowning the view, was a bare 
                hilltop. In the centre of this hilltop was a clump of pines." Most of his father's
                 visits to the forest at that time were, he noted, family expeditions on foot "to 
                 make yet another attempt to count the pine trees on Gill's Lap or to search for the
                  marsh gentian".</p>
